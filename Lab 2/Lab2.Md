Lab 2

1. The key point in this article is the four essential freedoms of open sourece.
That is, the freedom to run the program, to study how the program works, to redistribute the program, and to distribute your modifications to the program.

2. It is important to choose a license so that a project can clearly define the usage and distribution that it allows, while still remaining open source.
This gives the project's creators confidence that it will be used as intended, and gives its users confidence in what they may and may not do with the project.

3. A project without a license should not be used, because a project with no license defaults to all rights reserved, which means all rights under copyright law apply to the project.
Even though this may not be the project author's intention, the end result is that users and contributors cannot use or modify the project with confidence.

4. I agree with the claim that the failure to follow the open systems model was primarily responsible for Gopher's demise.
Through my own experience with the Open Source community, I have witnessed first hand the effect that efficient collaboration has on a project, and how starkly this contrasts with the development of closed-source projects.
In particular, the claim that people will be incentivised to give back to a project that they use themselves is undeniable, and the ties to the Linux project serve as an excellent example of 
a community of people contributing to a project that they themselves use.

5. The fact that Linux uses the GPL v2 license is both very logical and smart. As I mentioned in question 4, the Linux community is as successful as it is precisely because of the community's open source mentality.
As long as Linux remains under some form of the GPL license, all forks of the project must also follow the GPL license, meaning they too will remain open source.
In this way, the project guarantees that its open source nature will never die out.

6. My example project is the project I have recently undertaken and devoted much of my time over the past several weeks to: condition-based procedural mesh generation in Unity.
The license that I have selected for this project is the Apache License 2.0.

7. Of the GPL, LGPL, and Apache licenses, I belive the best for the common good is undisputably the GPL. As the GPL provides the most freedoms to learn from, modify, and redistribute any work,
it will naturally be the most beneficial to all who wish to learn from or use a project. For developers, which license is best will depend on the scope and intended use of their project.
The LGPL may be best for a developer who wishes to open source their work, but will also use it as a component of a larger project to which they do not wish to release the source code.
For a company, the Apache license may be more suitable, due to the fact that this license also grants the contributors patent rights, allowing the company to potentially benefit from their work.

8. Repository with accompanying license located here: https://github.com/rystills/procedural-mesh-generator (currently private repo, will be made public in time)

9. I think my procedural mesh generator is an appropriate project to work on for this course. The users of this project will be Unity developers who wish to incorporate procedural meshes into their games/projects.
Other users of this project will be developers who are interested in procedural mesh generation, and wish to learn from or contribute to the work. 
The license I have chosen for this project is the Apache License 2.0. I have chosen this license as I wish for this project to be open source, but still wish to reserve patent rights.
