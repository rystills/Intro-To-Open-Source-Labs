Book: Free Culture - Catalogs
This chapter of the book discusses the RPI students who were sued due to developing a search engine which involved data mining. This chapter is very important, as it calls into question the nature of piracy. Most people today would consider the actions of the students to be legal; they only stored indexed data to which they had access. Moreover, this practice is now commonplace among search providers and large businesses alike. The proceeding lawsuit and its unfortunate outcome stresses the importance of free culture, especially in regards to technology. All people should have the same right to use technology however they see fit, so long as they are not expressly breaking the rules of other software packages' licenses.
